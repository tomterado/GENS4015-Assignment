<p> This game I created is an expression of how science how helped us evolve into a much smarter society with the advent of knowledge and communication however also showcases the consequences we face if we do not understand how adverse these scientific advancements are having on our modern day society. Below is a supporting description of the game and my perspective to it.  </p>

<p> Communication has being one of the biggest indicators for the homo-sapiens survival [1] and has allows us to socialise, read, write and progressively learn from one other. This was further accelerated in the new age of the semiconductor industry supported by Moore’s Law which has allowed society to compute information search at unimaginable heights in the new Internet/Digital Age. It them provided platforms where billions of people can now readily message another or create content via platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. These respective platforms/companies known as the  FAAG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google) have allowed us to effectively communicate with the large trade off of our own privacy and self-sovereignty in the digital world. This has become increasingly apparent in the recent data leak scandals such as the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, US Presidential campaigns and many more due to the lack of education of what it means to agree to the T&C and privacy policies of these companies.  </p>

<p> A great perspective which outlines the consequences is from esteemed cryptographer and computer scientist David Chaum in 1985- “Computerisation is robbing individuals of the ability to monitor and control the ways information about them is used. Already, public and private sector organisations acquire extensive personal information and exchange it amongst themselves. Individuals have no way of knowing if this information is inaccurate, outdated, or otherwise inappropriate… The automation of payment and other consumer transactions is expanding these dangers to an unprecedented extent” [2]. As similarly argued in Adolf Huxley’s essay on Decentralisation and Self Government [3] , Chaum and Huxley both describe the move away from such central powers with the need for individuals to move towards a (scientific) society of self-sovereignty and self-identity as opposed to relying on such centralised powers to aggregate data that could be used against us.  </p>

<p>  Overall this game is an expression of opinion is that if technological sciences are going to enhance our lives, we have become more educated and internalise awareness of our digital actions regarding the trade off for convenience and privacy. Whether it is through newer scientific improvements such as the Blockchain where data can rely on consensus mechanisms as opposed to third party providers such Facebook, there is a strong necessity for users of the digital age to start paying attention to the forewarnings of both Chaum and Huxley.  </p>
